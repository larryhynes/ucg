## Introduction

UniversalCodeGrep (ucg) is an extremely fast grep-like tool specialized for searching large bodies of source code.  It is intended to be largely command-line compatible with [`Ack`](http://beyondgrep.com/), to some extent with [`ag`](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/), and where appropriate with `grep`.  Search patterns are specified as PCRE regexes. 

### Speed
`ucg` is intended to address the impatient programmer's code searching needs.  `ucg` is written in C++11 and takes advantage of the concurrency (and other) support of the language to increase scanning speed while reducing reliance on third-party libraries and increasing portability.  Regex scanning is provided by the [PCRE library](http://www.pcre.org/), with its [JIT compilation feature](http://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrejit.html) providing a huge performance gain on most platforms.

As a consequence of its use of these facilities and its overall design for maximum concurrency and speed, `ucg` is extremely fast.  Under Fedora 23, scanning the Boost 1.58.0 source tree with `ucg` 0.2.2, [`ag`](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) 0.31.0, and `ack` 2.14 produces the following results:

| Command | Elapsed Real Time, Average of 5 Runs |
|---------|-----------------------|
| `time ucg --noenv --cpp 'BOOST.*HPP' ~/src/boost_1_58_0` | ~ 0.404 seconds |
| `time ag --cpp 'BOOST.*HPP' ~/src/boost_1_58_0`  | ~ 5.8862 seconds |
| `time ack --noenv --cpp 'BOOST.*HPP' ~/src/boost_1_58_0` | ~ 12.0398 seconds |

UniversalCodeGrep is in fact somewhat faster than `grep` itself.  Again under Fedora 23 and searching the Boost 1.58.0 source tree, `ucg` bests grep 2.22 not only in ease-of-use but in raw speed:

| Command | Elapsed Real Time, Average of 5 Runs |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `time grep -Ern --color --include=\*.cpp --include=\*.hpp --include=\*.h --include=\*.cc --include=\*.cxx 'BOOST.*HPP' ~/src/boost_1_58_0` | ~ 0.9852 seconds |
| `time ucg --noenv --cpp 'BOOST.*HPP' ~/src/boost_1_58_0`  | ~ 0.404 seconds |

The resulting matches are identical.

## Installation

### Ubuntu PPA

If you are a Ubuntu user, the easiest way to install UniversalCodeGrep is from the Launchpad PPA [here](https://launchpad.net/~grvs/+archive/ubuntu/ucg).  To install from the command line:

```sh
# Add the PPA to your system:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:grvs/ucg
# Pull down the latest lists of software from all archives:
sudo apt-get update
# Install ucg:
sudo apt-get install universalcodegrep
```

### Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS dnf/yum Repository

If you are a Red Hat, Fedora, or CentOS user, the easiest way to install UniversalCodeGrep is from the Fedora Copr-hosted dnf/yum repository [here](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/grvs/UniversalCodeGrep).  Installation is as simple as:

```sh
# Add the Copr repo to your system:
sudo dnf copr enable grvs/UniversalCodeGrep
# Install UniversalCodeGrep:
sudo dnf install universalcodegrep
```

### Arch Linux User Repository

If you are a Arch Linux user, the easiest way to install UniversalCodeGrep is from the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR) [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ucg/).  Installation is as simple as:

```sh
# Install using yaourt:
yaourt -S ucg
# Install manually:
cd /tmp/
curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/ucg.tar.gz
tar -xvf ucg.tar.gz
cd ycg
makepkg -sri
```

### openSUSE Binary RPMs

Binary RPMs for openSUSE are available [here](https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg/releases/tag/0.2.2).

### Building the Source Tarball

UniversalCodeGrep can be built and installed from the distribution tarball (available [here](https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg/releases/download/0.2.2/universalcodegrep-0.2.2.tar.gz)) in the standard autotools manner:

```sh
tar -xaf universalcodegrep-0.2.2.tar.gz
cd universalcodegrep-0.2.2.tar.gz
./configure
make
make install
```

This will install the `ucg` executable in `/usr/local/bin`.  If you wish to install it elsewhere or don't have permissions on `/usr/local/bin`, specify an installation prefix on the `./configure` command line:

```sh
./configure --prefix=~/<install-root-dir>
```

#### Build Prerequisites

##### `gcc` version 4.8 or greater.

Versions of `gcc` prior to 4.8 do not have sufficiently complete C++11 support to build `ucg`.

##### `pcre` version 8.21 or greater.

This should be available from your Linux distro.

### Supported OSes and Distributions

UniversalCodeGrep should build and function anywhere the prerequisites are available.  It has been built and tested on the following OSes/distros:

- Linux
  - Ubuntu 15.04
  - CentOS 7
  - Fedora 22
  - Fedora 23
  - RHEL 7
  - SLE 12
  - openSUSE 13.2
  - openSUSE Leap 42.1
- Windows 7 + Cygwin 64-bit (Note however that speed here is comparable to `ag`)

## Usage

Invoking `ucg` is the same as with `ack` or `ag`:

```sh
ucg [OPTION...] PATTERN [FILES OR DIRECTORIES]
```

...where `PATTERN` is an PCRE-compatible regular expression.

If no `FILES OR DIRECTORIES` are specified, searching starts in the current directory.

### Command Line Options

Version 0.2.2 of `ucg` supports a significant subset of the options supported by `ack`.  Future releases will have support for more options.

#### Searching

## Configuration (.ucgrc) Files

UniversalCodeGrep supports configuration files with the name `.ucgrc`, in which command-line options can be stored on a per-user and per-directory-hierarchy basis.

### Format

`.ucgrc` files are text files with a simple format.  Each line of text can be either:

1. A single-line comment.  The line must start with a `#` and the comment continues for the rest of the line.
2. A command-line parameter.  This must be exactly as if it was given on the command line.

### Location and Read Order

When `ucg` is invoked, it looks for command-line options from the following locations in the following order:

1. The `.ucgrc` file in the user's `$HOME` directory, if any.
2. The first `.ucgrc` file found, if any, by walking up the component directories of the current working directory.  This traversal stops at either the user's `$HOME` directory or the root directory.  This is called the project config file, and is intended to live in the top-level directory of a project directory hierarchy.
3. The command line itself.

Options read later will override earlier options.

## User-Defined File Types

`ucg` supports user-defined file types with the `--type-set=TYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS` and `--type-add=TYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS` command-line options.  Only two FILTERs are currently supported, `ext` (extension list) and `is` (literal filename).

### Extension List Filter

The extension list filter allows you to specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which are to be considered as belonging to file type TYPE.
Example:
`--type-set=type1:ext:abc,xqz,def`

### Literal Filename Filter

The literal filename filter simply specifies a single literal filename which is to be considered as belonging to file type TYPE.
Example:
`--type-add=autoconf:is:configure.ac`
